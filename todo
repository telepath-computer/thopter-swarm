- test heartbeat survives suspend/resume cycle via tini. (looks like not yet?)
- install a ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md for host level instructions about thopter context as a runloop devbox, it's a headless kvm context, using and pushing only to thopter/* git branches for workspace. the main thing is that it needs to know to use thopter/* pattern branches for any pushes to remote git. it should be told about the github pat and how git config is setup to use that.
- Test this with a real developer implementation task round-tripping from Git
- Teach Claude how to update it's task status, give it a skill maybe
- Set up some common slash commands
- Have developer names and associate them with thopters.
- Write better docs.
- Put API keys and such in team 1Password.
- review the auto suspend logic make sure it's sane and that it works
- claude statuses per claude PID instead of per thopter
- document recommended iterm2 changes:
  - enable "Applications in terminal may access Clipboard."
  - enable "copy to clipboard on selection"
  - enable "mirror tmux paste buffer to clipoard"
- Try building a task system in Redis
- Profiles: named configuration bundles for different projects/workflows.
  A profile would control:
  - Which secrets get injected (subset of Runloop secrets)
  - Custom init script / dependency installation per profile
  - Default snapshot (per-profile golden image instead of one global default)
  - Resource size (not everything needs LARGE)
  - Idle timeout
  - Repo URL + branch to clone
  - Git identity (bot user, email)
  Profile name gets tagged as metadata on the devbox.
  Stored in local config (~/.runloop-thopters/profiles/).
  Usage: ./rt create --profile my-project

- DONE Upgrade Runloop account to enable suspend/resume
- DONE Sign up for a paid run loop account.
- DONE completely replace this repo with the run loop implementation.
- DONE setup starship.
- DONE Implement hooks to update status for when a thopter is waiting on input or is done and install them in new thopters
