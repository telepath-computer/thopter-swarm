types.ts:                                                   
  - agent_id legacy field must be changed, and the session observer script must be updated. NO LEGACY FIELDS! change ALL CODE that deals with legacy fields.
  - hasObserver can be dropped, as redundant (session data presence = has observer)
  - machineId and id in golden claude state - simplify to just machineId

thopter-utils.ts:
  - it's fine. calling getOrphanStatus() is fine, it's not making fly calls, it's just simple js checks. run it liberally i don't care.
                                                                                                                                                                      
state-manager.ts:                                                   
  - fix GoldenClaudeState to just machineId w/ duplicate 'id'
  - thopter and golden claude reconciliation are safe to coexist because they look at different namespaces in the fly.io machines list. golden claude reconciliation should not be writing to the thopters list. golden claudes are a separate list. 
  - regarding race conditions between updateThopterFromStatus and the reconciliation (for thopters), do these really conflit? fly machine reconciliation should be updating the fly fields, while updating status should be updating the session fields. right? carefully think through if there is any actual data clobbering - for example the overall record references being replaced vs partial/patching updates of the relevant attribute groups.
  - regarding addThopter data being bulldozed by reconciliation - doesn't the reconciliation logic PATCH the thopter with fly data, thus keeping existing fields like the hub properties? is it completely replacing the whole record?
  - for error handling on reconciliation, it's okay, let it recover the next round.
  - for memory leaks / circular buffers, is this really a concern? it's not just a FIFO queue w/ standard javascript garbage collection?

agent-manager.ts:
  - go ahead and rename 'agent' language to 'thopter'
  - it's fine for destroy handling to block new thopter provisioning if that's what you're worried about.
  - regarding "State Race Condition: Lines 139-145 - addThopter() immediately adds to state, but if reconciliation runs before the observer reports in, it might lose the GitHub context." -- again, aren't state updates basically PATCH semantics? if not that is a problem.
  - capacity check timing is probly fine, it does not have to be perfect. provisioning of a machine is a blocking operation before the next agent loop right?

provisioner.ts:
  - go ahead and rename 'agent' language to 'thopter'

collector/index.ts:
  - use of agent_id: no. stop using legacy fields. change the session observer and the collector. NO LEGACY FIELDS!!!!

dashboard/index.ts:
  - go ahead and rename 'agent' language to 'thopter'
  - expensive categorization and grouping operations: so long as these don't make fly calls or exec out, it's fine. even hundreds of thopters will be performant enough if this is just javascript function overhead.
  - use helpers in the template for consistency

index.ts:
  - go ahead and rename 'agent' language to 'thopter' (keeping AgentManager class name only)

github-polling-manager.ts:

  - Memory Growth: Line 19 - processedCommands: this is okay for now, i will open a ticket for later to deal with this.
  - go ahead and rename 'agent' language to 'thopter' (keeping AgentManager class name only)


utils.ts:
  - go ahead and rename 'agent' language to 'thopter'
  - ensure no legacy state attributes (agentId etc)

views/dashboard.ejs:
  - completely review and update to correct schema and helpers

views/agent-detail.ejs:
  - completely review and update to correct schema and helpers
